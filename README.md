# Hi, I'm Petr

Full stack developer ¬∑ Based in Bali üèù Indonesia.

I have been online since table layout was the norm for building websites,  
which is both hilarious and sad at the same time.

`Modus operandi`
### What can you expect

I have been in the industry for a while now.  
From a total beginner to a junior with huge ego and fanatically high code standards for no practical reason, to today's senior (maybe?) full-stack dev who communicates clearly and delivers on time.

#### Used technology

I rarely jump on the hype bandwagon anymore. I've seen too much cool tech come and go.  
For new projects, I will pick the ideal stack based on current and planned requirements. For existing ones, we'll use the boring (but working) stack that's already in place.

#### Communication

I take release dates seriously.If there's a roadblock, I will let you know asap so that everyone has time to adjust and reiterate.I don't deliver surprises, and I'm not a yes-man who's scared to admit he made a wrong estimate.

#### Problem solving

Whatever task or problem you throw at me, I will deal with.
And I won't make the budget bleed while doing it, either.That's because I've been fiddling with computers for 2 decades now. So when there is a problem, I can diagnose it faster than beginners.
